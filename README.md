This is a React app created as part of a tech test created by Co-op Bank. The app will display as many Chuck Norris Jokes as you can handle.

It also allows you to add your own name to the jokes in the 'Search Jokes' tab.

**Running the app**

To run this project you will need to download it onto your local machine and install all dependencies.

Navigate inside the directory and install all dependencies by entering the following command on your terminal window:

`npm install`

Once completed, run:

`npm start`

In the future, I would add the following features:
1. Infinite scrolling feature for Infinte Jokes page
2. Replace male pronouns with gender neutral pronouns for Search Joke feature
